# BurbnBot
Instagram Was First Called 'Burbn'.
Kevin Systrom, the creativity researcher Keith Sawyer explains, was a fan of Kentucky whiskeys. So when he created a location-based iPhone app—one driven by the success of networking app Foursquare—he named it after the booze. The app was complicated, but it took Systrom just a few months to build: Burbn let users check in at particular locations, make plans for future check-ins, earn points for hanging out with friends, and post pictures of the meet-ups.

BurbnBot is a bot for automated interaction in a famous social media app using Android Virtual Devices.

I'm sorry for the lack of documentation.
